This repository covers the computational (not graphical) part of working with automata. Here range from algorithms of minimisation of automata, regular operations to synthesis of automata from a regular expression, and much more.

The language used in this context is Wolfram (Mathematica), due to the convenience of working with nested lists (as discussed later). How the automata will be represented in this language and many more abstractions can be found on "basics.txt".

Since working with automata requires a strong sense of formal languages, regular languages and many more basic concepts, this knowledge is already assumed. However, even though it's not its main goal, this repository includes a few programs and examples of formal languages.
