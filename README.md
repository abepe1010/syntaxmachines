This repository covers the computational (not graphical) part of working with automata. Here range algorithms of minimisation of automata, regular operations, synthesis of automata from a regular expression, etc.

The language used in this context is Mathematica, due to the convenience of working with nested lists (as discussed later). How the automata will be represented in this language and many more abstractions can be found on "basics.txt".

Since working with automata requires a strong sense of formal languages, regular languages and many more basic concepts, a few programs and examples can be found within this repository, however it's not its purpose.
